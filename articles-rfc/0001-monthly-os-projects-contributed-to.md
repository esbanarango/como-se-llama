## Summary

Promote the culture of giving back to the community throught OS contributions in projects (addons) we rely on / use.
Pick a list of 4 or 6 issues each month and try to work on those, we can then summarize each month the ones we solved and the ones we struggled on.

This would be a recurring article each month.

Projects we could look at:

`ember-power-select`
`ember-modal-dialog`
`ember-sortable`
`ember-test-selectors`
`ember-concurrency`
`ember-cli-page-object`
